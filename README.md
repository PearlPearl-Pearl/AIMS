## AIMS REPO

As a student at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS), Rwanda the idea behind this repo is for documenting my academic work there. Hopefully I'm able to look back on this at the end and see growth, while also providing resources for the next generation of AIMS studnets.
