# AIMS REPO

As a student at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS), Rwanda, the idea behind this repo is for documenting my academic work. Hopefully I'm able to look back on this at the end and see growth, while also providing resources for the next generation of AIMS students.

## Structure
The AIMS academic year is divided into 3 phases: `Skills Phase`, `Review Phase`, and `Essay Phase`.
Each phase is divided into `blocks` of 3 weeks, where a minimum of 2 courses are taken per block. There are 3 blocks in the `Skills Phase`, 6 blocks in the `Review Phase` and 8-10 weeks in the `Essay Phase` where students are required to conduct some research, along with a supervisor, on a topic proposed by the lecturers.

Students enrolled into AIMS Rwanda are required to go through a compulsory 4 week pre-resumption phase in order to get them up to speed and brush up on their skills in Mathematics and Python.

### Skills Phase
#### Block 1
- **[Mathematical Problem Solving](skill_phase/block_1/MPS/)**

The aim of this course is to build on the skills already learned, and apply them to different problems in Mathematics.
- **[Introduction to Computing and LaTeX](skill_phase/block_1/ICL/)**

This course is taken to build students' confidence in LaTeX (a typesetting tool for mathematicians), and other essential skills like shell scripting and R programming language.


#### Block 2
- **[Physical Problem Solving](skill_phase/block_2/PPS/)**

### PS
This `README` will be updated as I go through the program with relevant information on the materials in the folders. A final update would be made to this document on the last day of the program.üî•üî•
So help me God!‚ù§üöÄüéØ.
