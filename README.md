# AIMS REPO

As a student at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS), Rwanda, the idea behind this repo is for documenting my academic work there. Hopefully I'm able to look back on this at the end and see growth, while also providing resources for the next generation of AIMS students.

## Structure
The AIMS academic year is divided into 3 phases: `Skills Phase`, `Review Phase`, and `Essay Phase`.
Each phase is divided into `blocks` of 3 weeks, where a minimum of 2 courses are taken per block. There are 3 blocks in the `Skills Phase`, 6 blocks in the `Review Phase` and 8-10 weeks in the `Essay Phase` where students are required to conduct some research, along with a supervisor, on a topic proposed by the lecturers.

Students enrolled into AIMS Rwanda are required to go through a compulsory 4 week pre-resumption phase in order to get them up to speed and brush up on their skills in Mathematics and Python.
